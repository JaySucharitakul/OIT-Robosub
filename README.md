	Introduction
Everything will be done mainly in Visual Studio 2017 using C++ for vision processing and machine learning.
Hardware control for the sub will be accomplished primarily using Atmel Studio using C code on an ATMEGA328p microcontroller.

	OpenCV Section

The following link is where you can download the OpenCV Library. As a cautionary step, try to match your current version of Microsoft
Visual Studio with the release date of an OpenCV update, i.e., Visual Studio 2017 should be paired with an OpenCV update released the 
same year.

The next link provides a short YouTube series on the basics of using OpenCV, as well as how to install it on a Windows-based 
installation of Visual Studio. If Visual Studio fails to run the example code provided in the OpenCV file downloaded previously, let me 
know and I can provide assistance during the next meeting.

	Machine Learning Section

The following is a list of websites to get started on researching Machine Learning (ML) to use in our design for the sub.

	Long Term Goals
Eventually, using an FPGA to either replace/complement the Microcontroller on the Sub Arduino would provide some unique implications in terms of computational speed and hardware control. If an FPGA were to be integrated, likely an Intel FPGA, or Xilinx Board, SystemVerilog would be the optimal choice for HDL usage.
